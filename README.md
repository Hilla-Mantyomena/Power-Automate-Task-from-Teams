# Power-Automate-Task-from-Teams
This is a very simple cloud flow to create To-Do tasks directly from Teams messages. It works for private chats, group chats and channels. You can add your own details to the task but it also saves the context of the task automatically, so you can easily go back to the conversation where the task was assigned to you.

You can trigger this flow directly from Teams, making your work flow easier (no switching between To-Do and Teams!):

You can add your own details to the task, such as task title and notes:

The task contais the original context, such as who sent the message, original message content and also a link to the message:
